<h1>Fast3D Displaylist Macros (Commands)</h1>
<p>Fast3D is the name of the microcode (a microcode is basically a graphics driver for the N64 in very rough and simplified terms) that <i>Super Mario 64</i> uses. This page hopefully will be of use to you as it demonstrates all of the available macros for use in a display list.</p>
<h2>Difference Between Commands and Macros</h2>
<p>A command is literal data being sent to the RSP telling it to perform an action. Most people who have done binary ROM hacking have likely experienced using F3D commands and editing them through a hex editor. Assembler macros greatly simplify the process of tweaking a displaylist by combining several commands into one with an easier syntax. In order to use the macros, you must add <span class="codeinline">.include "ultra64/gbi.inc"</span> to your assembler file</span></p>
<h2>gSP Macros</h2>

<h3>gsSPVertex <span class="codeinline">[VERTEX GROUP LABEL] [AMOUNT], [OFFSET]</span></h3>
<p>Loads vertices in to the vertex cache starting from where <span class="codeinline">[VERTEX GROUP LABEL]</span> is placed. The amount of vertices loaded in is decided by <span class="codeinline">[AMOUNT]</span> and the range is 0-15 (16 total). <span class="codeinline">[OFFSET]</span> is 1-16 and decides where in the vertex group list to start. The numerical equivalent to this command is <span class="codeinline">0x04</span>, also known as <span class="codeinline">G_VTX</span>.</p>
