<h1>Fast3D Displaylist Macros (Commands)</h1>
<p>Fast3D is the name of the microcode (a microcode is basically a graphics driver for the N64 in very rough and simplified terms) that <i>Super Mario 64</i> uses. This page hopefully will be of use to you as it demonstrates all of the available macros for use in a display list.</p>
<h2>Difference Between Commands and Macros</h2>
<p>A command is literal data being sent to the RCP telling it to perform an action. Most people who have done binary ROM hacking have likely experienced using F3D commands and editing them through a hex editor. Assembler macros greatly simplify the process of tweaking a displaylist by combining several commands into one with an easier syntax. In order to use the macros, you must add <span class="codeinline">.include "ultra64/gbi.inc"</span> and <span class="codeinline">.include macros.inc</span> near the top of your assembler file</span></p>
<h2>gSP Macros</h2>

<h3>gsSPMatrix <span class=codeinline>[MATRIX GROUP LABEL], [PARAMETER]</span></h3>
<p>Inserts matrix operations into the display list using the matrix data from <span class="codeinline">[MATRIX GROUP LABEL]</span> and performs the operation given by <span class="codeinline">[PARAMETER]</span>. <span class="codeinline">[PARAMETER]</span> is able to be:</p>

<table>
	<tr>
		<th>Parameter</th>
		<th>Numerical Equivalent</th>
		<th>Effect</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><span class="codeinline">G_MTX_PROJECTION</span></td>
		<td><span class="codeinline">01</span></td>
		<td>Operate on the projection matrix stack</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><span class="codeinline">G_MTX_MODELVIEW</span></td>
		<td><span class="codeinline">00</span></td>
		<td>Operate on the model view matrix stack</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><span class="codeinline">G_MTX_MUL</span></td>
		<td><span class="codeinline">01</span></td>
		<td>Multiply top of matrix stack and matrix m</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><span class="codeinline">G_MTX_LOAD</span></td>
		<td><span class="codeinline">02</span></td>
		<td>Load matrix m at top</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><span class="codeinline">G_MTX_NOPUSH</span></td>
		<td><span class="codeinline">01</span></td>
		<td>Do not push on matrix stack before matrix operation</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><span class="codeinline">G_MTX_PUSH</span></td>
		<td><span class="codeinline">04</span></td>
		<td>Push on matrix stack before matrix operation</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<p><b>Note:</b> You can perform multiple operations at once by adding the numerical equivalents and using the sum for <span class="codeinline">[PARAMETER]</span>.  For example, if you wished to use <span class="codeinline">G_MTX_PROJECTION</span> and <span class="codeinline">G_MTX_LOAD</span>, your <span class="codeinline">[PARAMETER]</span> would simply be <span class="codeinline">3</span>.

<h3>gsSPLight</h3>
<p>Todo: Work on this.</p>
<h3>gsSPVertex <span class="codeinline">[VERTEX GROUP LABEL] [AMOUNT], [OFFSET]</span></h3>
<p>Loads vertices in to the vertex cache starting from where <span class="codeinline">[VERTEX GROUP LABEL]</span> is placed. The amount of vertices loaded in is decided by <span class="codeinline">[AMOUNT]</span> and the range is 0-15 (16 total). <span class="codeinline">[OFFSET]</span> is 1-16 and decides where in the vertex group list to start. The numerical equivalent to this command is <span class="codeinline">0x04</span>, also known as <span class="codeinline">G_VTX</span>.</p>

<h4>Microcode Differences</h4>
<p>This macro slightly differs between certain microcodes. The notable differences are:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc">
<li>When using the Fast3D Extended (F3DEX) and Fast3D Extended 2 (F3DEX2) microcodes, <span class="codeinline">[AMOUNT]</span> supports a range of 0-31 (32 total) vertices to be loaded at once, and as expected <span class="codeinline">[OFFSET]</span> ranges from 1-32 as well.</li>
<li>When using the F3DEX Rejection and F3DEX2 Rejection microcodes, the ranges are 0-63 (64 total) and 1-64 for <span class="codeinline">[AMOUNT]</span> and <span class="codeinline">[OFFSET]</span> respectively.</li>
</ul>
